Python and Matlab scripts to slice panoramic images into squares to post to instagram

The motivation for these scripts arose when I failed to find any free online tools to split a pano image into square images for instagram. 

The available free software would consistently post water marks on the pictures.These simple scripts take in a panoramic image and split the image into squares with width equal to the original height of the image. 

Both python and matlab scripts are available in their corresponding folders

Here is a quick example:

Input Pano:

The script splits the image as follows:

![alt text](read_me_imgs/output_img1.jpg?raw=true "Output Img 1") ![alt text](read_me_imgs/output_img2.jpg?raw=true "Output Img 2") ![alt text](read_me_imgs/output_img3.jpg?raw=true "Output Img 3") ![alt text](read_me_imgs/output_img4.jpg?raw=true "Output Img 4")
